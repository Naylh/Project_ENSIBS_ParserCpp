# CPP Project - Software Cybersecurity Promotion


## Project Explanation

During our first year at ENSIBS, we had to carry out a project in C++.

The proposed project aims to simulate the behavior of communication networks.

A file
input describes the topology of the network and the communication traffic to be implemented, and it is
expected in output a display of the processing results obtained for example by files
display using the GnuPlot tool.

The project will be divided into 3 parts (epics), each part has specific and essential missions for the proper functioning of the system


- Read and capture information from valid .csv files
- Propose a design of the information of the file allowing to apply to it to
term of graph manipulation algorithms in order to define the path of flows
Communication.
-  Generate display files of networks and flow paths on this network

**Regular meetings also made it possible to report on the progress of the project with the teacher.**


**To date "10/05", here is our progress:**
---

- [x] Analysis of file errors
- [x] Standard reading
- [x] Application on file parser
- [x] Capture the information of each row
- [x] Propose a description design on the static part with UML notation
- [x] Design as Parser classes  
- [x] Display in standard output in raw data
- [x] Provision of a design document using UML notation
- [x] Propose a design of the information of the file allowing to apply algorithms to it in the long term
- [ ] Indicate how it facilitates the capture of communication paths
- [ ] From an internal representation of networks and flows, generate a results file
- [ ] Generate display files of networks and flow paths on this network
- [ ] A Gnuplot or analog type display is expected

## We are very satisfied with our ease on this project and our speed in this design
